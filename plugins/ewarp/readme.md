# ewarp
A simple AM/RM and spectrum reverse warp plugin.  

# why
Have you ever heard about **prosoniq piwarp** or **zynaptiq wormhole**? I am trying to recreate that warping effect.But this prototype is too far away from that goal now.

# Features
- build-in DSF oscillator for modulation  
- reverse spectrum
- Only Reverse --> AM --> RM  

# how does it sounds like?
tested with saw tooth.  
trash, really harsh clicks.
